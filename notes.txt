This app is Dockerized and should easily run with a simple `docker-compose up`. The app will be hosted on http://localhost:8080.

Otherwise, it's just a basic Phoenix app, using most of the auto-generated stuff from `mix phx.new` (default DB configuration will be in config/dev.exs, etc.).

```
npm --prefix=assets install
mix deps.get
mix do ecto.create, ecto.migrate # Setup the DB schema

mix phx.server # Runs the server, will be hosted at http://localhost:4000
mix test # If you want to run the tests
```

Most non-boilerplate code will be in `lib/url_shorten_web/live/page_live.ex`, `lib/url_shorten_web/controllers/redirect_controller.ex`, and `lib/url_shorten/shortener.ex`.
Relevant test code will be in `/test/url_shorten_web/live/page_live_test.exs` and `/test/url_shorten/shortener_test.exs`.

Things that could be improved:

1. I made zero CSS edits and barely touched the HTML templates, so the project is just an Elixir flex. I should've tried a basic React frontend since y'all use React, but didn't in the interest of time.
2. Slug generation is unsophisticated... collisions might be possible, I'm not sure.
3. Probably should have used a different model name than Slug. `slug.url` and `slug.slug` are a bit awkward.

Anyway. Looking forward to your review.
